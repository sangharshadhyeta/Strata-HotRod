// include/strata/artifact/model_family.hpp - which model family a GGUF holds, from its general.architecture.
//
// Strata was written for one model (Qwen3.8-Flash-Next, `qwen4exp`).  Qwen3.6-35B-A3B (`qwen35moe`) is a close
// cousin (same tokenizer, the same Gated-DeltaNet + gated-attention 3:1 layer pattern, the same head dims), so the
// reader, the geometry and the layout tables know both.  The ENGINE runs only the families `model_family_runs`
// names; a recognised family it does not run yet is refused with `model_family_not_supported`, not mis-run.
//
// No dependencies: the GGUF reader (the architecture guard) and the core geometry both include this.
